            <br/><br/>
            <p>Woolworths is Australia's largest supermarket chain. 
               Operating 995 stores across Australia, Woolworths relies on the 115,000 team members in stores, distribution centres and support offices to provide our customers with superior service, range, value and convenience.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>Woolworths operates in a very congested market. They have competition on the food side from Spar, Pick 'n Pay, Shoprite, and on the clothing front from The Foshini Group and Mr Price. Their net profit margins are however superior to most of these retailers, offering 
            a compelling value investment case before even digging any deeper into their financial results (which we do below).</p>
